# regeneration_rhomboids
A MorphoMechanX model for simulating the cell shape changes driving the initial stages of root tip shape restoration during regeneration.

Plugin for MorphoMechanX(www.MorphoMechanX.org) to generate 2D simulations of a growing root tip tissue during regeneration after the root tip has been cut off. The model is based on a cell-based FEM mechanics model
